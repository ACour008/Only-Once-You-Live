##Main Premise
You've found yourself in a dark underworld with one chance to make it through a trickster's platform city. Can you do it? You only live once, after all.


##Known bugs
- If you get pushed backwards far enough, you could lose control of the character until you die.
- The platforms randomly generate in a way that makes it unforgiving to the player at times.
- The background is not a seemless loop.
- The player is supposed to have a new face for each game (they're really funny), but it doesn't happen.
