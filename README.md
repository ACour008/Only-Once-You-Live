* Version: 1.0.0
* Source: https://github.com/ACour008/GameHighedJam.git
* Playable version: https://acour008.itch.io/only-once-you-live
* Our submission to the 2021 Game Highed Jam hosted by Charles Games, BUG Game Lab, guvencat & ragnor8k

## New Build NOW AVAILABLE
We made some major updates to our game for the final produce
- Screen size is now wider (so you can see what is coming at you)
- New 'obstacles' added. They may or may not kill you.
- Additional sounds, animations, and easter eggs.
- Oh, and the player sometimes has a moustache.

## Main Premise
You've found yourself in a dark underworld with one chance to make it through a trickster's platform city. Can you do it? You only live once, after all.

## Known bugs
- [FIXED] ~~If you get pushed backwards far enough, you could lose control of the character until you die.~~
- [FIXED] ~~The platforms randomly generate in a way that makes it unforgiving to the player at times.~~
- [FIXED] ~~The background is not a seemless loop.~~
- [FIXED] ~~The player is supposed to have a new face for each game (they're really funny), but it doesn't happen.~~

## Find any bugs?
- Of course you did. No matter, let us know!
